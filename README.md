# Matplot-challenge

I don't know if this was a double-blind study or not, so I can't evaluate what the numbers say with complete authority. But what I see helps me to draw the following conclusions:

1) The studies were fairly equal in the number of test subjects and testing points. They were also nearly equally split between male and female. These lead me to believe that each drug was tested equally in terms of test subjects.

2) The boxplots lead me to believe that Capomulin resulted in the mice having the smallest tumors, with Ramicane close behind. Capomulin also has a slightly smaller IR.

3) In the treatment of interest, the tumors in mouse s185 consistently became smaller over the 45 day test.

4) Finally, when the average tumor volume of each mouse is compared to its weight, it has a fairly high correlation of 70%. More calculation should be done to determine if the shrinking tumor size has anything to do with the overall size of the mouse.
